# Grad PPT

This project uses [slidev](https://sli.dev), which is a markdown-to-presentation library. (You may also need to know `tailwindcss` to achieve fully understanding. )

To generate the powerpoint, first import the students' images in `./img/students/`, import the excel at `./index.xlsx`.


install openpyxl using pip

install npm packages `pnpm install`

run `python script/generate_slides.py`

then `pnpm dev`


You may modify the `aspectRatio` in the frontmatter of `slides.md`
